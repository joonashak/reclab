# Recover Laboratory Web

## Installation

As some commands, such as development mode tests, are run on the host machine instead of a container, you will need to install the dependecies first.

### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm run init
```

## Development Environment

The development environment is configured with npm and Docker. You will need to have the `npm` and `docker` commands available on your system (tested only on macOS).

> _**Note on updating content:**_ Upon making changes it is currently necessary to restart the frontend container to have Gatsby rebuild with new static content. Use `npm run restart` for this.

All commands below should be run in project root. The npm scripts in subdirectories are meant for internal use by the scripts in root.

### Start Development Environment

```bash
npm start
```

This command brings up the containers in the background. The services are accessible at

- [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) (frontend),
- [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001/) (backend), and,
- [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) (Adminer).

### Stop Development Environment

```bash
npm stop
```

### Restart Development Environment

```bash
npm run restart
```

Note that changes are hot-realoaded only from the `/cms/src` and `/web/src` directories. If you make changes outside of these locations, you will need to restart the containers.

### View Logging Output

View all logs:

```bash
npm run logs
```

View logs by service (frontend/backend/database, respectively):

```bash
npm run logs:<cms|web|db>
```

## Testing

In CI, all tests are run in containers. While this can be achieved locally with the `npm run test:ci` command, the development environment is designed to allow for running test unintrusively while coding.

Make sure the development environment is running before using the commands below.

### Run All Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Run Only CMS Integration Tests

```bash
npm run test:cms
```

### Check Linting

```bash
npm run test:lint
```

### Open Cypress

For use when writing tests.

```bash
npm run test:open
```

## Maintenance

### Build All Containers

```bash
npm run build
```

### Build Specific Container

Use this, for example, when you update CMS content or dependencies (frontend/backend, respectively):

```bash
npm run logs:<cms|web>
```

## Deployment Pipeline

The pipeline is set up for trunk-based development with pull requests and releases used as deployment triggers.

1. Push changes to `trunk` branch. Github runs tests for the new `HEAD`.
2. Create a pull request to merge changes from `trunk` to `main`. The merge can be completed once all tests have passed. This triggers deployment to staging.
3. Publish a new release to deploy to production.

## Propagating Content Changes to Static Frontend

Gatsby is used to populate the site with CMS data at build time. To achieve convenient re-deployments upon content changes, a webhook must be set-up for the CMS backend to be able to trigger re-deployment. The project is configured for Vercel static site hosting.
